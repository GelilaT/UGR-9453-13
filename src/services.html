            <p>As event organizers, we are responsible for organizing and managing every aspect of an event. 
              our duties include conceptualizing theme ideas, planning budgets, booking venues, liaising with suppliers and clients, managing logistics, and presenting post-event reports.
              We seek to be highly creative and organized event planner to help execute unforgettable events that generate brand awareness, build business relationships, and boost employee morale. 
              We will be responsible for conceptualizing ideas for the events, creating and enforcing budgets, liaising with suppliers, communicating with clients, and ultimately ensuring that each event is flawlessly executed.</p>

            <img src="images/event planning.png" alt="4 people sitting around a table with their laptops and discussing">
            <p>Our job as an event planner is much more than hanging up streamers, laying table clothes down and checking the quality of the lights.  
               Event planning requires tedious work and strenuous planning. We do everything involved with making sure these events go as anticipated. 
               This includes, working with the client to choose a fabulous and affordable location, hiring quality caterers, selecting perfect entertainment, and even arranging lodging and transportation for attendees who are visiting from afar.  
               Our goal is to make sure the event runs very much as anticipated, which includes multiple plans to combat what-if scenario, because no event will ever run exactly as planned.
