        <h2>SOME OF OUR WORKS</h2>
        <div>
        <img src="images/musicfest.jpg" alt="rear view of excited people with arms raised having fun">
        <p>This was a picture of a music festival that occurs once every month. 
            These events attract hundreds of people to gather together in order to appreciate the beautiful music. 
            Some take place in forests or deserts, and others in indoor facilities. The location of a music festival is an influential factor impacting one’s adventure as it shapes how one experiences the music itself. 
            There is an iconic electronic dance music themed festival that shines and sells out month after month. </p>

        <div>
            <img src="images/self development.jpg" alt="a group people attending a self development program">
            <p>This event was packed full of practical strategies and unforgettably inspiring lessons for living a more positive and productive life. 
                But this was more than just an event. It's an immersive experience that gave proven tools to identify and transform the negative, self-limiting beliefs and behaviors that keep people stuck.
                From proven ways to foster healthier relationships… to actions engineered to help you let go of painful experiences and emotions… to rituals guaranteed to increase your productivity, the talks and workshops at this event will inspire and equip you to become your most effective self.</p>

            <img src="images/charity event.jpeg" alt="people sitting on round tables at high profile charity event">
            <p>A charity event serves two purposes: to raise awareness for a specific cause and raise money. 
                People by nature are very charitable and are willing to give to your organization to make a difference.
                It’s up to you, though, to explain what your charity is and how it’s impacting lives. 
                By planning better charity events we maximize both attendance and monetary donations.</p>
